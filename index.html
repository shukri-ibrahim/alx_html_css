    <p>They absorb emissions from the air, acting as a great storage system – or ‘carbon sink’ - for the greenhouse gases that contribute to global heating. Forests could provide more than one-third of the total Co2 reductions required to keep global warming below 2°C through to 2030.</p>

    <p>Tropical forests such as those in the Amazon basin and Congo Basin are particularly critical to climate efforts, because they store the most carbon. They are mainly hardwood and have no dormant period.</p>

    <p>We want justice for those disproportionately affected by the climate crisis: people in the global south, indigenous communities and communities of colour, women and younger generations. We want corporations to respect the planet and human rights, governments to protect and listen to their citizens, and the online world to be free from misinformation and hate. </p>
